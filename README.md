# Baggage Guardian: AI-Powered Automated Baggage Counter System

**An intelligent, scalable solution for secure and efficient baggage management in large public spaces**

## üìã Project Overview

**Baggage Guardian** is an advanced AI-driven automated baggage counter system engineered to enhance security and efficiency in high-traffic public environments such as malls, shops, and transportation hubs. Leveraging **Raspberry Pi** as the central processing unit, **ESP32** for IoT connectivity, an **electronic lock system** for secure access, and a **display screen** for user interaction, this platform automates the allocation of free counters, captures customer images, and securely encodes data into a centralized database. Upon reaching the assigned counter, customers scan to access their baggage, while the system continuously monitors bag retention times and alerts security to anomalies. Optimized for handling large datasets with minimal latency, BaggageGuardian simplifies management oversight and addresses the critical lack of safe, cost-effective baggage storage in public areas.

Developed by an Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering enthusiast, this project exemplifies cutting-edge hardware-software integration, real-time monitoring, and data optimization, making it a robust solution for modern public space challenges.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Driven Counter Allocation**:  
  Intelligently assigns free counters based on real-time availability using AI algorithms.
- **Secure Authentication**:  
  Captures customer images and encodes data into a centralized database, accessible via scanning at the counter.
- **Electronic Lock Integration**:  
  Utilizes ESP32-controlled electronic locks for secure baggage storage and release.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**:  
  Tracks baggage retention times and triggers security alerts for irregularities.
- **Low-Latency Data Handling**:  
  Implements optimization techniques to process large datasets efficiently, ensuring rapid response times.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Features a display screen for customer guidance and status updates.
- **Centralized Management**:  
  Provides administrators with a unified dashboard to oversee all counters and security events.
